TaskRef: "Generate JPEG for brochure-2025"

Learnings:
- The `npm run generate` script is a long-running, asynchronous command. It involves starting a dev server, launching Puppeteer, rendering a page, and saving a file.
- The `execute_command` tool's success message indicates that a command has *started* successfully, not necessarily that it has *completed*.

Difficulties:
- I incorrectly assumed the asset generation command was instantaneous and proceeded to the next step (verifying file existence) too quickly. This led to a failed verification step and required user intervention.

Successes:
- The user's feedback was crucial in identifying my flawed assumption.
- The `brochure-2025.jpeg` asset was ultimately generated successfully once enough time was allowed.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- General Pattern: When executing a command that is likely to be a long-running process (e.g., builds, server tasks, complex file generation), do not immediately assume completion. Wait for a clear signal of success or a reasonable amount of time before proceeding with verification steps.
